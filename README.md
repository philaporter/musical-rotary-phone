# React Rick, Morty, Jerry Thumbnails Project
This project is basically what I made when I followed along with a Udemy React course by Stephen Grider. This project is pretty simple, but gets into reusable components and React basics.

## Setup
`npm install`
`gulp`

## Run
Open index.html in your browser
